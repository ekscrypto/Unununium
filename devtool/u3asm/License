  - Phil Frost is not sued because of something stupid you did.
  - Proper credit is given to the authors of the software, and that such credit

It is the belief of Phil Frost that:

  - Software is not to be licensed, but rather purchaced and owned like
    everything else.
  - Profit is not obscene if both parties involved mutually benefit.
  - What one may do with his property should not be restricted.
  - Everyone has become overly pananoid concerning legal issues. So much so that
    most people think a "c" enclosed in parenthesis is some rune that entitles
    one to special rights, but only when closely accompanied by at least two
    pages of magic script and at least one paragraph exclusively in uppercase.

Phil Frost has put forth much time to contribute to this software from which you
