Howto make an app for UUU ?

 1) Create your app (using stdlibs ONLY)
 2) Compile it:
 	gcc -c myapp.cpp -o myapp.o
 	
 3) Make the clibs (if not done)
 	cd devtool/clibs
 	make 
 	(the files will be created in clibs/bin)	<TODO>
 	
 4) Link your app with everything you use
		ld -r myapp.o stdio.o -o myapp.o
		
 5) Convert it to UBF (UUU Binary Format)
 		elf2ubf myapp.o myapp
 		
 6) Copy your app to the UUU floppy
 	(mount /floppy)
 	cp myapp /floppy/bin
 	
 DONE!

[NOTE] The libs aren't done yet!!!

<ToDO>	[ ] Better makefiles (with make clean, stdio etc)
	[ ] also, place assembled clibs in clibs/bin
