How to use this boot record


1.) Create a ext2 file system on your floppy
    a) login as root
    b) mke2fs /dev/fd0   (or appropriate drive)

2.) Build the distribution for a location of 1MB
    a) open the makefile of the distro you want to build
    b) locate the U3LFLAGS= line
    c) locate the --offset=value in this line
    d) change the value to 00100000
    e) locate on the same line the --stack-location=value option
       note: if this option is missing, you may add it at the end of the others
    f) set this value to 00007A00
    g) save the makefile and exit
    h) type: make u3core.bin

3.) Copy the u3core.bin binary to the file system
    a) login as root
    b) mount the floppy with the file system
       i.e.: mount /dev/fd0 /floppy
    c) copy the u3core.bin file to the root directory of the floppy
       i.e.: cp u3core.bin /floppy
    d) unmount the floppy
       i.e.: umount /floppy

4.) Install the boot record onto the floppy
    a) go in uuu/src/boot/ext2_boot
    b) type: make
    c) type: make install

You are now ready to boot the floppy!  Note, some distributions might require
other files to be located on the drive, make sure you read the distribution's
documentations before launching the system.
