Potassium information sheet

Atomic Number: 19
Atomic Symbol: K
Atomic Weight: 39.098

Uses

The greatest demand for potash has been in its use for fertilizers. Potassium
is an essential constituent for plant growth and is found in most soils.

An alloy of sodium and potassium (NaK) is used as a heat-transfer medium. Many
potassium salts are of utmost importance, including the hydroxide, nitrate,
carbonate, chloride, chlorate, bromide, iodide, cyanide, sulfate, chromate,
and dichromate.

History

(English, potash - pot ashes; L.. kalium, Arab qali, alkali) Discovered in 1807
by Davy, who obtained it from caustic potash (KOH); this was the first metal
isolated by electrolysis.

Sources

The metal is the seventh most abundant and makes up about 2.4% by weight of the
earth's crust. Most potassium minerals are insoluble and the metal is obtained
from them only with great difficulty.

Certain minerals, however, such as sylvite, carnallite, langbeinite, and
polyhalite are found in ancientlake and sea beds and form rather extensive
deposits from which potassium and its salts can readily be obtained. Potash is
mined in Germany, New Mexico, California, Utah, and elsewhere. Large deposits
of potash, found at a depth of some 3000 ft in Saskatchewan, promise to be
important in coming years.

Potassium is also found in the ocean, but is present only in relatively small
amounts, compared to sodium.

Properties

It is one of the most reactive and electropositive of metals. Except for
lithium, it is the lightest known metal. It is soft, easily cut with a knife,
and is silvery in appearance immediately after a fresh surface is exposed. It
rapidly oxidizes in air and must be preserved in a mineral oil such as kerosene.

As with other metals of the alkali group, it decomposes in water with the
evolution of hydrogen. It catches fire spontaneously on water. Potassium and
its salts impart a violet color to flames.
