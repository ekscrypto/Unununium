Sb16 - A very simple sounblaster(16/pro/compatibles) driver.

The soundblaster 16 should be detected completely automatically.

If you have a Sounblaster(pro/compatible), you need to modify the DMA and IRQ
preferences ONLY. 
On the EOF you will find the variables "sb.irq" and "sb.dma8" needed to do this.

PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS/HARDWAREINCOMPATIBILITIES!
