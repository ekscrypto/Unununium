Command line options:
---------------------

 --offset=value

   Allow the user to override default linking offset. The value must be
   specified using hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F) and cannot go above
   FFFFFFFF. Note that 0x prefix or h suffix should not be used.

 --include-drp

   Activate the generation of dynamic recalculation information in the
   final object.

 --help

   Display command line options and syntax, similar to this section.
   
 --abort-on-warning

   Will cause the execution to stop after the first phase generating a warning
   and will return with error code 'total warnings'+'total errors'

 --generate-fid-listing[=file]

   Activate the generation of the various provided functions and classes.
   Optionally, a filename can be specified, by default the file is
   'funtiosn.txt'
 
 --hybrid-objects

   If you need to link an object file that contain both special os wrapper
   sections and normal cell sections, you need to use this option, otherwise
   you will get warnings at link time.

 --include-zero-size-sections

   Nasm and some other compilers/assemblers sometime generate by 'mistake'
   zero size sections.  Those sections can normally be removed without any
   damage to the final produced file and are by default removed.  By using
   this option, you will force the inclusion of those empty sections. This
   feature can be used when you desire to create a cell header for the os
   wrapper but have the 'cell' itself take no space in the final image other
   than its header.
 

Special sections:
-----------------

The following sections have special meanings:

OS Wrapper sections
  .osw_pre_init
  .osw_interinit_code
  .osw_post_init

Cells sections
  .c_onetime_init
  .c_init
  .c_info

When the core image is generated, the header will contain the following infos:

00  4  Signature "CoRE"
04  1  Core header revision, currently 0x01
05  1  reserved for future use
06  2  Number of cells linked
08  4  Total Size
0C  4  Offset core is linked for
10  4  Checksum of the entire core image
14  4  OS wrapper entry point (__osw_entry global)
18  4  Offset to DRP table
1C  4  Offset to DLP Absolute table
20  4  Offset to DLP Relative table

Following this structure located at the start of the core image, is all the
various cell information headers, which are of the following format:

00  4  Offset within the core + linked offset, to the start of the cell
04  4  Total size required by the cell
08  4  Offset within the core + linked offset, to .c_info information section
